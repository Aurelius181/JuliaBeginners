## Week 1

Start of the course!

There are nine lesson pdfs, and all are essential. We strongly recommend that you do them in order (`L1W1_MinimalWorkingExample.pdf` is the first).

At the end of this week (which of course might take you longer or shorter than a calendar week to work through) you should have a working knowledge of the Julia REPL, an understanding that programming is *expressive use* of a *formal language* via *applied formal logic*, and be well placed for starting to code in Julia.
